        about a decade of his life off and on with the property and could never get a movie off the ground. But
        something changed in him when he was working on the Netflix limited series Godless in 2017 and this revelation
        led to him and Allan Scott to turn away from the idea of making a movie and instead turned their focus to a
        miniseries.

        In the documentary short Creating The Queen’s Gambit, Scott Frank and Allan Scott both pointed out that
        extending the scope of the story to be told over the course of a miniseries, as opposed to a movie, presented
        them with more freedom the extend the narrative while also providing other challenges, namely making it to where
        the audience would remain invested in Beth Harmon over multiple episodes.</p>

        Taylor-Joy was approached so early a script wasn’t written yet and all the actress had to go off of was a copy
        of Walter Tevis’ novel. During an interview with Netflix Queue, Taylor-Joy revealed that as soon as Scott Frank
        gave her a copy of the book, she was sold, saying she knew she wanted to play Beth Harmon immediately after
        reading the book but had to push her away so that she wouldn’t get wrapped up in the character before being cast
        in the role</p>
