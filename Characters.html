          <p>Elizabeth "Beth" Olivia Harmon is a chess prodigy and the main character in the Netflix miniseries, The
            Queen's Gambit. Orphaned at a young age and scarred from Methuen Home's mistreatment, she is depicted as
            someone with immense anger and passion, which fuels her chess proficiencyâ€”and her susceptibility to
            substance addiction.</p>
          <p>While she accepts herself as someone who breaks gender norms, Harmon has expressed irritation with being
            renowned solely because of her gender. She experiences difficulty forming relationships with others that are
            not based on chess because of this.</p>
          <p>In addition to chess, Harmon maintains skills in mathematics, sciences, and history. Over the course of
            five years, she acquires a knowledge of Russian, which allows her to eavesdrop on gossip by people who
            assume she cannot understand the language.</p>
          <p>Harmon is played predominantly by Anya Taylor-Joy, and she is played by Annabeth Kelly as a five-year-old
            and Isla Johnston for other younger scenes.</p>

          <p class="w3-left-align">Benjamin Watts is an arrogant, popular, and very intelligent chess prodigy and a main
            character in the Netflix series, The Queen's Gambit. Initially Beth Harmon's most prominent rival, he then
            becomes her mentor, close friend and love interest.
            Benny was first introduced into the show in episode 3. At the time he was 23 and visiting the U.S. opening
            in Cincinnati where he met Beth. She was 15 when they met and had just won the Kentucky State championship.
          </p>

          <p>Notwithstanding his hubris, Benny is a wise chess player who has studied a variety of chess playing styles
            across all time controls. He mirrors Harmon's abilities to visualize chess positions in his head, yet Benny
            does so without the aid of drugs (a detail which inspires Harmon). Overall, as a coach, he imparts on Harmon
            valuable experience and self-care which she long ignored, allowing her to succeed against Soviet Grandmaster
            Vasily Borgov.</p>

          <p>Alma Wheatley is a lonely housewife with an absent husband and her own vices. She and her husband Allston
            reside at 4400 Reed Lane, Lexington Kentucky.</p>
          <p>She welcomes Beth as both her adopted daughter and much-needed companion. As a girl she had ambitions to be
            a concert pianist and still likes to play, but her career was derailed by stage fright. When Beth is on the
            rise in the chess world, she acts as her manager and accompanies her to tournaments all over the United
            States. At Beth's first major international tournament in Mexico City, she hooks up with an old pen friend
            named Manuel and begins an affair with him, however Manuel leaves her after about a week. Shortly afterwards
            Beth discovers Alma dead in her hotel room of suspected hepatitis, exacerbated by her alcoholism.</p>

          <p>Although initially committed to becoming a chess grandmaster, by the end of the series he has become an
            assistant manager of a grocery store while studying to become an electrical engineer. At the downturn spiral
            of Beth's life, Harry tries to make Beth wake up since she is now an addict and wished her to be more
            careful at the end. He along with Beth's allies are the ones who planned to beat Borgov.</p>
